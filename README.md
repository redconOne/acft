<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [x] Include a modal with exercise description
- [ ] Further refine Records page
- [ ] Add settings
  - [ ] Save settings for next session

See the [open issues](https://github.com/redconOne/acft/issues) for a full list
of proposed features (and known issues).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Optimizations

An update/refactoring of the Records page is currently in development, as well
as a Settings page to adjust User Settings (like light/dark themes). Planned
future optimizations include ongoing improvements to the user interface and
navigation.

## Lessons Learned

I knew I wanted to incorporate an MVC structure to maintain organization during
development but also to allow future improvements and features to be implemented
post-production of ACFT. New features can easily be worked into a new or
exisiting model, followed by logic and data retrieval within the controllers to
then routing and paths be configured accordingly.

It was important to me to have a robust code base that would fascilitate
incorporating new features, but also modularity so that the views could be
swapped out to integrate a different front-end library, like React.
TailwindCSS + DaisyUI combination offered components and additional UI support I
had envisioned for a clean aesthetic and user friendly experience as part of the
project's core features.

A good portion involved using package libraries' respective documentation to
troubleshoot issues encountered along the way.
